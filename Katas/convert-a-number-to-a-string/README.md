## Description

We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

```if:c
In C, return a dynamically allocated string that will be freed by the test suite.
```

#### Examples (input --> output):

```
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"
```

~~~if:riscv
RISC-V: The function signature is:

```c
void number_to_string(int n, char *out);
```

Convert the input number `n` to a string, and write the result to `out`. You may assume `out` is large enough to hold the result. You do not need to return anything.
